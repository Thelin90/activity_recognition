# The Challenge

The challenge is about Activity Recognition.

The dataset contains raw data (over 1 million observations) for 9 different physical activities (such as walking, running, cycling, sitting, etc) performed by 7 different persons wearing each 3 inertial measurement units (IMU) and a heart rate monitor (HR). 

 

The IMU sensors were positioned as follows:

- 1 IMU on the right wrist of the user

- 1 IMU on the chest

- 1 IMU on the right ankle

 

The IMU sensory data contains the following measures:

- 3D-accelerometer data (m/s2)

- 3D-gyroscope data (rad/s)

- 3D-magnetometer data (Î¼T)

 

The IMU sensors have a sampling frequency of 100Hz and the sampling frequency of the HR-monitor is approximately 9Hz. Given the difference in the frequency of the captured data, the missing HR-values are indicated with NaN in the dataset. 

 

We would like you to perform an exploratory analysis on this dataset, and run any data processing required to perhaps build a machine learning model to predict the activity. You can use any tool or coding language you are comfortable with. 

 

We are mainly interested in the way you think about the challenge and how you would design a solution rather than the prediction model itself and its accuracy.
